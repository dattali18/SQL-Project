# Specification Document

## Part 1: Designing the Database
- **Objective**: Design the database for the enterprise scenario using an ERD diagram and create the SQL schema.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create an ERD diagram representing the database structure.
  - Translate the ERD diagram into a SQL schema.
  - Populate the database with sample data to emulate a real-world scenario.

## Part 2: Creating Sample Queries
- **Objective**: Demonstrate the ability to think of and create complex queries.
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop a set of sample queries that showcase various aspects of the database schema.
  - Include queries that involve multiple tables and use different SQL clauses (e.g., JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, etc.).

## Part 3: Functions & Procedures
- **Objective**: Use PL/SQL to implement functions and procedures that enhance the database functionality.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create functions and procedures that perform specific tasks within the database.
  - Examples include calculating values, updating records, or generating reports.

## Part 4: Integration with Other Teams
- **Objective**: Integrate the database with other teams working on different parts of the enterprise scenario.
- **Tasks**:
  - Collaborate with other teams to understand their requirements for integrating with the database.
  - Implement the necessary changes to the database schema or functionality to support integration.
  - Provide documentation or assistance to ensure smooth integration between teams.

## Optional: Building a UI
- **Objective**: Create a user interface to showcase the project.
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop a backend using ASP.NET to connect to the Oracle database.
  - Build a frontend web application using React or another frontend library to interact with the database.
  - Ensure the UI is user-friendly and provides meaningful information about the project.

## Presentation
- **Objective**: Prepare a written summary of each part of the project with diagrams, textual explanations, code snippets, and screenshots.
- **Tasks**:
  - Summarize the key points of each part of the project.
  - Include diagrams (e.g., ERD, UI wireframes), textual explanations, and code snippets to illustrate the work done.
  - Provide screenshots of the UI (if applicable) to visually demonstrate the project.
