# Stage 1: Database Design and Implementation

## Implementation

### Enterprise: Airport

1. **Flights Management**
   - **Entities**: Flights, Airlines, Airports, Routes, Passengers, Crew Members, Aircraft, Flight Status, Booking

2. **Goods & Services Management**

   - **Entities**: Goods (e.g., luggage, cargo), Services (e.g., parking, catering), Inventory, Suppliers, Service Requests, Service Providers, Contracts

3. **User Management**
   - **Entities**: Users (e.g., passengers, staff), Roles, Permissions, Accounts, Customer Feedback, Customer Support, Employee Records, Training Records

> [!NOTE] This part is up to the other team, so we have no control over this

### Enterprise: Description

Our project focuses on emulating a part of an airport's database system. The database will manage various aspects of flight operations, passenger information, aircraft data, and more. This simulation aims to showcase the complexity and functionality required in a real-world airport setting.

The database will be designed to handle multiple entities such as flights, airlines, airports, passengers, crew members, aircraft, and bookings. Each entity plays a crucial role in the airport ecosystem, and the database will facilitate efficient management and interaction between these entities.

This project will help us understand and implement key database concepts such as entity-relationship modeling, normalization, and database management. It will also provide valuable experience in designing and implementing a database system for a complex real-world scenario.

### Schema & ERD

Sure! Here is a detailed description of the database design for the Flights Management system, incorporating the SQL script for table creation:

### Entities for Flights Management:

1. **Airlines**

   - **Attributes**:
     - Airline_ID (Primary Key): `INTEGER`
     - Airline_Name: `VARCHAR(100)`

     - One-to-Many (1:M) with Flights (Departure_Airport and Arrival_Airport)

3. **Aircraft**

   - **Attributes**:
     - Aircraft_ID (Primary Key): `INTEGER`
     - Aircraft_Type: `VARCHAR(100)`
     - Capacity: `INTEGER`
   - **Strong Entity**: Yes

5. **Flights**

   - **Attributes**:
     - Flight_ID (Primary Key): `INTEGER`
     - Flight_Number: `VARCHAR(15)`
     - Departure_Time: `DATE`
     - Arrival_Time: `DATE`
     - Departure_Airport: `INTEGER` (Foreign Key)

     - Passenger_ID: `INTEGER` (Foreign Key)
     - Flight_ID: `INTEGER` (Foreign Key)
   - **Weak Entity**: Yes
     - **Reason**: Booking has no meaning by itself; it has meaning only when attached to a specific flight and passenger.
   - **Relationships**:
     - Many-to-Many (M:M) with Passengers
     - Many-to-Many (M:M) with Flights

7. **CrewMembers**
   - **Attributes**:

   - **Strong Entity**: Yes
   - **Relationships**:
     - One-to-Many (1:M) with Flights

## Database Normal Form

### Normalization Explanation

Our database schema for the Flights Management system is normalized to the Third Normal Form (`3NF`). Each table has been carefully designed to ensure that all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key and not on any other non-key attribute, thereby eliminating any transitive dependencies. This design ensures that our schema is free from redundancy and potential update anomalies, leading to more efficient and reliable data management.

#### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Airlines**

   - Primary Key: `Airline_ID`
   - Non-key attributes (`Airline_Name`) are fully dependent on the primary key and do not depend on each other.

2. **Airports**

   - Primary Key: `Airport_ID`
   - Non-key attributes (`Airport_Name`, `Location`) are fully dependent on the primary key and do not depend on each other.

3. **Aircraft**

   - Primary Key: `Aircraft_ID`
   - Non-key attributes (`Aircraft_Type`, `Capacity`) are fully dependent on the primary key and do not depend on each other.

4. **Passengers**

   - Primary Key: `Passenger_ID`
   - Non-key attributes (`Passenger_Name`, `Passenger_Phone`, `Passenger_Email`, `Passport_Number`, `Passenger_Age`) are fully dependent on the primary key and do not depend on each other.

5. **Flights**

   - Primary Key: `Flight_ID`
   - Non-key attributes (`Flight_Number`, `Departure_Time`, `Arrival_Time`, `Departure_Airport`, `Arrival_Airport`, `Flight_Status`, `Aircraft_ID`, `Airline_ID`) are fully dependent on the primary key and do not depend on each other.

6. **Booking**

   - Composite Primary Key: (`Booking_ID`, `Passenger_ID`, `Flight_ID`)
   - Non-key attributes (`Seat_Number`, `Booking_Date`) are fully dependent on the composite primary key and do not depend on each other.

7. **CrewMembers**
   - Primary Key: `Crew_ID`
   - Non-key attributes (`Crew_Name`, `Crew_Role`, `Flight_ID`) are fully dependent on the primary key and do not depend on each other.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfChildren
FROM Flights
         JOIN Bookings ON Flights.FLIGHT_ID = Bookings.FLIGHT_ID
         JOIN Passengers ON Bookings.PASSENGER_ID = Passengers.PASSENGER_ID
WHERE Flights.DEPARTURE_AIRPORT = 1000
  AND Flights.DEPARTURE_TIME >= '2024-04-28'
  AND Passengers.PASSENGER_AGE < 8;
```

- Output: `NumberOfChildren`
